University assignment demonstrating the use of the A* algorithm and how it finds the shortest path quickly from a source node to a target node. Code is set up to take a variable sized .csv file for the node names, heuristics, and the adjacency matrix. Only the strings in main need to be changed to achieve a quick result.
